# AltSchool-Personal-Project
This project aims to provide valuable insights into population dynamics, growth rates, and variations across continents over time. They enable a comprehensive understanding of global population trends and patterns, aiding in demographic research, policy planning, and decision-making processes.
By leveraging a comprehensive dataset spanning six decades (1960-2020) and employing powerful Python libraries such as Pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn, we embark on an exciting journey to explore population growth, analyze trends, and present captivating visualizations.
Dataset and Scope: The dataset, sourced from https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/datasets.html, encompasses population figures from various countries across the globe. With each entry representing a unique snapshot of population data, we gain a comprehensive overview of how the world's population has evolved over time. This allows us to ask thought-provoking questions, investigate patterns, and uncover trends that shape our understanding of human expansion.
Data Cleaning and Transformation: Before diving into analysis, it is crucial to ensure the data is in an optimal format. To achieve this, we perform data cleaning and transformation steps using the Pandas library. We drop any unnecessary columns, such as serial numbers, to focus solely on relevant information. Additionally, we rename the remaining columns to display only the year figures, enhancing readability. Furthermore, we add a summary row that captures the total population for each year, enabling a more comprehensive view of global population growth.
